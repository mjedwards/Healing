											Sandra Hightower has been my message therapist for the last six months. She has made an incredible change in my life and health. I have had doctors diagnose with me Fibromyalgia and prescribe medication for my condition.She has relieved my debilitating aches and pains, and I am no longer taking medication. Sandra has helped with my regularity. As a menopausal woman I can't begin to tell you what that change has brought to my everyday health and happiness. I am now enjoying my day to day life. Sandra is someone that has helped me immensely and I strongly recommend you try her services, I can promise you will get results.

											I am pleased to write this recommendation on behalf of Sandra. After being in a car accident April 2011, I cracked my hip and was unable to walk for 4 months. After the bone healed, I was still in tremendous pain and dreaded trying to walk. I began physical therapy 3-4 times a week, in which the treatment was unsuccessful. I was still in pain and unable to walk. I began massage therapy with Sandra for hip and lower back pain September 2011. Sandra immediately figured out that my pain was generating from my psoas muscle in my stomach region. She worked on releasing the knots and spasms in that area. I was amazed that by the following week, the pain had nearly subsided by 50% and I could walk with little to no hesitation. I have continued my therapy with Sandra every week and now I am pain free. Sandra is amazing, always positive, friendly, and very concerned for her patients. I am very thankful to have been treated by Sandra because without her, I would still be in tremendous pain.

					Deep Tissue massage is designed to relieve severe tension in the muscle and the connective tissue or fascia. This type of massage focuses on the muscles located below the surface of the top muscles. Deep tissue massage is often recommended for individuals who experience consistent pain, are involved in heavy physical activity, such as athletes, and patients who have sustained physical injury. It is also not uncommon for receivers of Deep Tissue Massage to have their pain replaced with a new muscle ache for a day or two. Deep tissue work varies greatly. What one calls deep tissue another will call light. When receiving deep tissue work it is important to communicate what you are feeling.
					</p>
					
					
					
				
					<p id="info-2-content" class="text-dark info-item">
					Prenatal massage is similar to massage during non-pregnancy in terms of the goals (relaxation, pain relief, increased circulation & mobility, etc.). However, due to the changes undergone during pregnancy, modification are made. To accommodate swollen tender breasts and a growing belly, special pillows, positioning and techniques are utilized to ensure comfort for both the expecting mother and baby. With increasing weight, a changing center of gravity and the many other changes associated with pregnancy, prenatal massage can help provide relief and a sense of well being that is much deserved.
					</p>
					
					
					<p id="info-3-content" class="text-dark info-item">
					Sports massage is actually a form of Swedish massage that is delivered to athletes. Most commonly, sports massage focuses on increasing blood and lymphatic fluid flow, reducing and eliminating pain as well as tender trigger points, and increasing range of motion of the affected area. Sports massages can be broken into 4 distinct types - the pre-event sports massage, the post-event sports massage, the restorative sports massage and the rehabilitative sports massage. As the names indicate, each type of sports massage has a different focus for the athlete as they are delivered at different times during their training and performance schedule.
				    </p>
					
				
				    <p id="info-4-content" class="text-dark info-item">
					A stone massage uses cold or water-heated stones to apply pressure and heat to the body. Stones coated in oil can also be used by the therapist delivering various massaging strokes. The hot stones used are commonly river stones which over time, have become extremely polished and smooth. As the stones are placed along the recipient's back, they help to retain heat which then deeply penetrates into the muscles, releasing tension.
					</p>
					
				
					<p id="info-5-content" class="text-dark info-item">
					Swedish massage uses five styles of long, flowing strokes to massage. The five basic strokes are effleurage (sliding or gliding), petrissage (kneading), tapotement (rhythmic tapping), friction (cross fiber) and vibration/shaking. Swedish massage has shown to be helpful in reducing pain, joint stiffness, and improving function in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee over a period of eight weeks. It has also been shown to be helpful in individuals with poor circulation. The development of Swedish massage is credited to Per Henrik Ling, though the Dutch practitioner Johan Georg Mezger adopted the French names to denote the basic strokes. The term "Swedish" massage is not really known in the country of Sweden, where it is called "classic massage".

					<p id="info-6-content" class="text-dark info-item">	
					Trigger points or trigger sites are described as hyperirritable spots in skeletal muscle that are associated with palpable nodules in taut bands of muscle fibers. Trigger point practitioners believe that palpable nodules are small contraction knots[ambiguous] and a common cause of pain. Compression of a trigger point may elicit local tenderness, referred pain, or local twitch response. The local twitch response is not the same as a muscle spasm. This is because a muscle spasm refers to the entire muscle entirely contracting whereas the local twitch response also refers to the entire muscle but only involves a small twitch, no contraction. The trigger point model states that unexplained pain frequently radiates from these points of local tenderness to broader areas, sometimes distant from the trigger point itself. Practitioners claim to have identified reliable referred pain patterns, allowing practitioners to associate pain in one location with trigger points elsewhere.
